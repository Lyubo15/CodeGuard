Please review the code by following these prompts:
1. Imagine you are a senior software engineer. Let's step by step review the code.
2. –ês a technical interviewer, show me the bad and the good parts of the code regarding best practices and fundamental programming skills.
3. Evaluate the code at what level it is written. Junior, Mid or Senior Developer.
4. Score the codebase on clean code from 1/5 with a few examples of why (is the naming good, is there proper logging).
5. From 1 to 5 with a few examples of why (are modern language features used, is a popular framework used, are framework best practices followed).
6. Evaluate the usage of design patterns in the codebase and check for any code smell and anti-patterns.
7. Check if the code adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
8. Identify potential memory leaks or resource management issues and check for performance optimizations and potential bottlenecks.
9. Evaluate error-handling mechanisms and suggestions for improvement.
10. Assess adherence to SOLID principles of object-oriented design and rate code maintainability.
11. Check for hard-coded values.
12. Assess compliance with platform-specific coding guidelines (e.g., Coding Style).
13. Is there redundancy in code, and can it be refactored to eliminate duplication?
14. How are dependencies mocked or stubbed in unit tests for isolation?
15. How well is the code designed for scalability, and is it ready to accommodate growth in data or traffic?
16. How extensible is the code? Can new features or components be added with minimal impact on existing code?
17. Is the code handle asynchronous operations effectively, such as callbacks, promises, or async/await?
18. If using a specific framework or library, ensure adherence to its best practices and guidelines.
19. Review the structure of test classes and test resources. Are tests organized alongside the production code, do they cover different scenarios, and do they follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., Test class names ending with "Test")?
20. Is the component modular, promoting re-usability in different parts of the application?
21. Are there clear boundaries between this component and other components?
22. How is the component's state managed? Does it use local state, context, or Redux (if applicable)?
23. Is the state properly initialized, updated, and cleaned up as needed?
24. Are lifecycle methods or lifecycle hooks used appropriately (e.g., componentDidMount in React or ngOnInit in Angular)?
25. Is there proper handling of component unmounting and cleanup (if applicable)?
26. Has the code been documented? (Yes/No)
27. Evaluate the design of RESTful endpoints in the controller. Are the endpoints well-structured and follow REST conventions (e.g., proper use of HTTP methods, resource naming)? If there is noting about controller just return N/A
28. Review the usage of dependency injection. Are dependencies injected through constructor injection, setter injection, or field injection? Are there circular dependencies?
