Please review the code by following these prompts:

1. General Code Review: Conduct a step-by-step review of the code, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement, and provide an overall quality summary.
2. Best Practices: Analyze the code as a technical interviewer, identifying best practices followed and fundamental programming violations.
3. Developer Level Assessment: Evaluate whether the code is written at a Junior, Mid, or Senior level, with justification based on complexity, readability, and maintainability.
4. Clean Code Score: Score the code from 1 to 10 based on naming conventions, logging, formatting, and clarity, with examples of well-written and poorly-written parts.
5. Modern Features: Assess the usage of modern language features, framework capabilities, and best practices to determine if up-to-date coding techniques are applied.
6. Design Patterns & Code Smells: Identify and evaluate the usage of design patterns, detect code smells, and highlight any anti-patterns.
7. DRY Principle: Check if the code adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by identifying unnecessary duplication and suggesting refactoring opportunities.
8. Performance & Optimization: Identify potential memory leaks, inefficient loops, unoptimized queries, and suggest performance improvements.
9. Error Handling: Evaluate how errors are handled (try-catch, logging, fail-safe mechanisms) and suggest improvements for robustness and clarity.
11. SOLID Principles: Assess adherence to SOLID principles and overall maintainability, providing a score based on maintainability and good design practices.
12. Hard-Coded Values: Identify any hard-coded values that should be parameterized or extracted into configurations for better flexibility.
13. Platform-Specific Guidelines: Check if the code follows platform-specific best practices for languages and frameworks such as Java, .NET, Python, or React.
14. Redundancy & Refactoring: Detect redundant code and suggest refactoring opportunities to improve efficiency and maintainability.
15. Unit Testing & Mocking: Review unit test coverage, structure, and mocking/stubbing practices to ensure effective test isolation.
16. Scalability Readiness: Evaluate how well the code is designed to handle increasing data, traffic, and concurrent user load.
17. Extensibility: Assess whether new features can be added with minimal impact, identifying rigid parts that may hinder future expansion.
18. Asynchronous Handling: Evaluate how well the code manages asynchronous operations such as callbacks, promises, and async/await, ensuring correctness.
19. Framework Best Practices: Check if the code adheres to best practices for the specific framework or library used, ensuring compliance with its conventions.
20. Test Organization & Structure: Assess if tests are well-structured, properly named, and organized correctly, following standard conventions.
21. Modularity & Reusability: Determine if the code promotes modularity and reusability across different parts of the application.
22. Component Boundaries: Check if clear component boundaries are established, ensuring proper separation of concerns.
23. State Management: Evaluate how the component manages state, including proper initialization, updates, and cleanup.
24. Lifecycle Handling: Assess the proper usage of lifecycle methods or hooks in frameworks such as React (componentDidMount) or Angular (ngOnInit).
25. Cleanup Handling: Verify if proper unmounting and cleanup mechanisms are implemented to prevent memory leaks or unintended behavior.
26. Documentation: Determine if the code is well-documented with clear and concise comments that aid understanding.
27. RESTful API Design: Evaluate RESTful endpoints, checking if they follow proper resource naming, HTTP methods, and REST conventions (return N/A if not applicable).
28. Dependency Injection: Review the usage of dependency injection, ensuring proper injection methods (constructor, setter, or field injection) and detecting circular dependencies.
